Funded by Health Bureau, a mega study on AMR named "A multifaceted approach in advancing infection control and prevention practices in residential care homes for the elderly (RCHEs) in Hong Kong
are conducted.

This study helps to outline and formulate guidelines for antibiotic stewardship programs-like interventions specific to Residential Care Home for the elderly in Hong Kong.
Due to the aging population, the number of RCHEs certainly rises. Given the intense (and inappropriate) use of antimicrobial therapy and the large proportion of infections treated in RCHEs, 
curbing antimicrobial resistance is of utmost importance. Hence, resources allocated to generate evidence-based interventions in this healthcare setting are rewarding. Amid a paucity of validated 
interventions to improve antimicrobial use in RCHEs, the significance of this study is to evaluate and to provide empirical evidence to a bundled set of interventions applicable in the local context.
